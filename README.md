# PHPcalculator

This calculator script was built for a coding challenge. You can enter any equation as a string (limit it to *,/,%,+,and -) and it returns a float as the answer. I chose a "float" instead of an "int" in case of any fractions from division (i.e. 2/3) The calculator will do the correct order of operations (not including parenthesis and exponents).
